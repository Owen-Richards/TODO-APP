# Todo web application

Workied in a group of 4 where each member had a different scrum role. These role 
were UI designer, Test Manager, Scrum Master, DevOps Manager and Requirement Manager.
My since we were a member short we all shared the role of UI designer.

## Result

The result of the project was a ToDo app hosted on heroku that utilized AWS storage for 
PDFs and user uploads, and a Django framework. Some of the languages used in the project 
were Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and C.

We utilized the google sign-in API to handle user login and make sure that the sign-ins were valid.
When on the app users can add, delete and edit their todo list which also adds the due date to the calendar 
if a due date is provided. The user can also join university courses in the app where they can post questions 
or comments to a message board and upload PDFs of assignments which is handled by AWS.

The project taught the fundamentals of web development and working in teams while also providing 
experience with new technologies.
